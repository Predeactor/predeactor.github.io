<p>My username on Internet is Predeactor, mostly with "Capitaine".
My real name is Julien, and as you may already guessed, I'm a passionated
developer. Most of the time, I work on Python (At least, when I'm writting this)
and I really enjoy making things for fun! There's nothing I need to worry about,
except school...</p>

<p>More about me is that I am a music lover, games player and content creator.
My style of music is the electro/pop, EDM in some case, but most importantly,
I **LOVE** vocaloids voices! Vocaloid are vocals made through computer, my 
favorite one is Hatsune Miku, most of you (If you encoutered me on Internet)
already know this fact.</p>

<p>I don't play a lot of games, but when I do, I really enjoy them.
i have a passion for horror game, but also PvP and adventure, you can find
